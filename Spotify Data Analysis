--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.--
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.--
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.--

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.--
--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.--

--What were the top 10 tracks on Spotify in 2021 based on popularity? Whom were those tracks by?--

SELECT artist_name
,track_name
,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What was the longest song on the Spotify Top 50 of 2021?--

SELECT track_name
,artist_name
,duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--What was the average popularity, tempo, and energy of the 2021 Spotify Top 50 by artist?--

SELECT artist_name AS Artist
,track_name AS Track
,ROUND(AVG(popularity),3) AS AveragePopularity
,ROUND(AVG(tempo),3) AS AverageTempo
,ROUND(AVG(energy),3) AS AverageEnergy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

--How many artists had 3 or more tracks on the Top 50 list? Who were those artist(s)?--

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name AS Artist
,COUNT(track_name) AS Tracks_On_Top_50
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(track_name) > 2
ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) DESC;
